## Summary  

In this fourth project meeting, the team reviewed the high-level system architecture and aligned on Jira issue creation practices. The group selected the most relevant User Stories from each Epic to implement first and clearly assigned each to a responsible member. Priorities were defined to focus on high and medium priority items before proceeding with lower ones.

## Achieved  

- Reviewed and defended the proposed high-level architecture.  
- Chose the most important User Stories per Epic to be implemented first.  
- Defined the responsible person for each selected User Story.  
- Established criteria for Jira issue creation.  
- Reinforced the importance of linking issues to User Stories and maintaining order in task execution.

## Next Steps  

- Implement selected User Stories according to priority and assignments.  
- Create Jira issues strictly linked to the corresponding User Stories.  
- Always include the Jira key in Git commits and branch names.  
- Avoid implementing work outside the scope of assigned User Stories.  
- Respect implementation order: finish all high and medium priority tasks in each Epic before starting others.

## Notes  

- Issues must always be linked to a User Story.  
- Jira keys are mandatory in branches and commits.  
- Do **not** implement features not explicitly required.  
  > *Example: avoid creating models for a User Story you’re not assigned to.*  
- Stick to priority: complete **high** and **medium** priority stories across all Epics before moving to lower-priority work.
