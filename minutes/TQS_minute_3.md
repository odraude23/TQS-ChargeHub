The team met to clean up the user stories, define an appropriate data model considering project constraints, review the quality and relevance of personas and scenarios, and align on next steps for the ChargeHub project.

- The most important thing is to make our work easier.  
- You can use GitHub to create branches, as long as you include the associated Jira Key.  
- Jira Key inclusion is mandatory for traceability.
